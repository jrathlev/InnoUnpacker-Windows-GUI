Instructions
============

Before compiling the project, the structure files of the different Inno Setup 
versions must be prepared.

1. Requirements:
----------------
- The unit "Struct.pas" of all versions to be supported each renamed to "Structvvvvu".  
  Inside the unit the name of the unit must be adapted.
- "StructTemplate.pas" as template for the structure interface units  
- The list "StructList" of all supported versions
- "CompressTemplate.pas" as template for the zlib compression versions 
- The list "CompressList" of all supported zlib versions
- Edit "VersionInfo.inc" to hold the correct version of innounp application

2. Preparation:
---------------
- Generate the units "StructVervvvvu" as interfaces to the above mentioned
  structure unit.
- Generate the include file "StructList.inc"
- Generate the units "CompressVervvvv"
- Generate the include file "CompressList.inc"
- Generate the resource script "version.rc" from "VersionInfo.inc"
- Compile "version.rc" to resource file ""version.res"  

To simplify the preparation, the batch script "prep.bat" can be used which will
perform all these steps in one go.

2. Compiling
------------
All sources are adapted to use Unicode strings (native string type since Delphi 2009).
Compilation was tested with Delphi 10 Seattle
