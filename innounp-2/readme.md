### Inno Setup Unpacker 2.64.6 - Console version

#### Unpacker for installations made by Inno Setup

#### Supports Inno Setup versions 2.0.7 to 6.4.3

##### Branch of the project on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp)

[Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is a popular program
for making software installations. *Inno Setup Unpacker* is a console application
to verify and get files out of the self-extracting executable.

Since there have been no updates of the *SourceForge* project since 2020 and the 
source codes are not yet adapted to the current Delphi versions (Unicode strings are 
the native type since *Delphi 2009*), I have modified them so that they can be 
compiled with newer Delphi versions (tested with *Delphi 10 Seattle*).
In addition, some errors have been fixed and new command line options (*-l*, *-i* and *-u*) were added, as well as exit codes to support the use in batch files. 

The install script is saved in UTF-8 format.

The program has also been adapted to *Inno Setup* versions 6.2 and 6.4.3.
